# My internship at MyGamePlan

Between 27th of February and 2nd of June 2023, I followed an internship at [MyGamePlan](https://www.mygameplan.ai/). This great company aims to automate many cumbersome processes still currently needing attention by personnel in Football teams.

## Overview

Lots of pen and paper-pushing is still happening in the great industry of football. MyGamePlan provides a way not only for football teams to automate these processes but also a one-stop shop for stats of not only their own players but also other teams.

The information encompassed, for each team using the app, includes performance data for which trackers can be made in order to help players improve their performance while also being able to glance over at other teams and prepare for the next game against that team.

So much information is contained that even videos of certain actions of players are kept a record of from previous games of a team. These videos can be shared with team members or downloaded. The performance data of these past games is also logged on the app.

## And? What about me?

My mission was to help MyGamePlan, a startup currently going strong in its development. I was greeted by a relatively small team of hard-working people. It took me a while to get settled in and acquire the necessary knowledge to dive into the code but nevertheless I ended up enjoying it way more than I initially expected to.

This internship consisted of the real software engineer experience. Like everyone else I met, I had to sit through morning stand-ups where I would communicate my goals for the day and would update the team on my progress.

I was tasked with several features to be developed for the app, most notably the refactor from Atlassian's AtlasKit component library to Google's MaterialUI. While the pattern of my work might seem similar from day to day in this time period, the challenges were never too repetitive. Every new feature came with more challenges than met the naked eye.

Lastly, I want to mention that within this time period lots of fun memories were also created. Besides the meetings and the written code, the team always had its way to keep us all motivated with a special End of Week meeting where we would discuss the company's progress in its mission.

We also had a [press event at the OH Leuven stadium](https://www.emerce.nl/wire/dankzij-ai-startup-mygameplan-scoren-alle-voetbalclubs-profvoetballers-voortaan-247-video-analyst-videocoach-data-scientist-maat) from which lots of visual memories occured.

Below, you can find the documents I have written as part of this internship where I will dive in deep detail about what has been achieved and what I was left with. Enjoy!

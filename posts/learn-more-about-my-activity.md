## Elision (January 2023 (2 weeks))

This was a first proper working experience as part of an IT e-commerce solutions providing organization and the big project I had to do on my senior year at Thomas More (Project 4.0). This was Elision of the Cronos Groep for whom we had to provide an e-commerce application in 2 weeks of realization precedented by 2 weeks of research and learning the never-before-seen-by-me-and-my-team technologies.

The idea was not only to get us out of our comfort zone as students but to also bring Cloud & Cybersecurity, Application Development and Artificial Intelligence together in one team to simulate the real dynamic of an IT work landscape.

## European Research Executive Agency (REA) (January 2016 (1 week))

During this experience, I was tasked with the development of an application whereby a calendar was available with the possibility to create events which the user got reminded about. I was supposed to do this full-stack with the most basic languages available to me (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP).

## European Executive Research Council Executive Agency (ERCEA) (January 2016 (after the above))

During this work experience, me and a classmate were tasked with the tracking of an organisation's progress with scientific research funded by the European Commission. We were given company names and we had to gather evidence to then support whether or not these companies were actually breaking ground or not in their research.

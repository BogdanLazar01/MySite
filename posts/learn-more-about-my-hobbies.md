# Computers

For the longest time, I spent time with **computers**. Ever since my childhood I had an obsession with **technical matters**. Computers happened to be one of these things I found so fascinating. I became pretty interested in gaming which stemmed a couple of other interests like **computer building** as well as other things. 

Of course, I wanted computers to be **my future**, but, unfortunately I was very discouraged from chasing this due to **my grades in mathematics**. These didn't change for the better at any point in my school years. I ended up trying to study for a **bachelor's in Business Administration** at the university of [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/). It was quite the disaster. I can only say I never thought I would fail so many subjects for how much work it took and how much time I'd put into these courses.

Needless to say, on top of my bleak future, I didn't enjoy BA too much either. Never truly saw a future for myself in it. After that, I dug back into what I knew I would like. I started with a Udemy course in the basics of Web development by **Rob Perceval (The Complete Web Developer Course)**. The course featured some material about becoming a freelancer which having tried, I knew I had to get a degree in order to have a more secure and organized path ahead of me. 

This led me to a portal where I could find all the degrees around Belgium where I ended up finding that the [Thomas More University of Applied Sciences](https://www.thomasmore.be/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAx6ugBhCcARIsAGNmMbgjLE3C_DV3chP0ffYEqjEwFluieK5c7U-XAhf5dhWk2kUe7zyHuD8aAiBJEALw_wcB) was teaching a for a new Bachelor's degree in **Applied Computer Science**.

I ended up receiving lots of useful knowledge about **programming languages** and doing some **amazing projects**. The rest is history.

# Cars

For the longest time, I have been a huge fan of cars. As a kid, I used to play lots of racing games. The most impactful one had to be **Gran Turismo 2** on the **Playstation 1** I received as a gift when I turned 1 (yes, really). 

This masterpiece gave the player the ability to buy cars, go racing, upgrade an existing car or buy more, get rewarded cars, you get the point. The main point of influence was the presence of so many iconic legends of the 90's car scene (The Evo VI, Honda Civic EK9, Skyline GT-R etc.). Then came the game's obsession with details like the encyclopedia that could be consulted for more information on how a car was made and the very in-depth explanation of car upgrades and how they make the car drive better.

As gaming evolved more and more and I got more and more influenced by more realistic aspects of driving like my first **go-kart race**, **sim racing** and others, I ultimately decided to get the best of both worlds (**daily driving + childhood dream**) when I turned 18 and got my **driver's license**. 

Up to finally purchasing my first car I was constantly getting through my tedious high-school classes by window-shopping for my car. I kept sending over announcements I had found for Celica's or 200SX's and others. It all finally came down to me purchasing an unbelivably clean and well-maintained **Civic EJ (EK) Hatchback** and the rest is history.

# Sports

When I was still in high school, I had a tough time just existing. I **didn't have almost any friends**, and I would spend most of my time reflecting upon things. I also had **very big self-confidence issues due to being overweight** on top of that. My **grades** were also not the best. It was a tumultuous time for me. Then I discovered **martial arts**.

I started practicing **Karate Shotokan** in my second year of high school. It quickly turned out to be a great getaway from my **everyday problems**. Not much later it also showed its long term **benefits for my health**. I quickly started considering that my physical condition played a very important role in how well I would perform, for which I started **lifting weights**. Little by little, I got to where I am today being able to press, row and squat **my bodyweight** with each leg.

Meanwhile, I had also gotten in touch with people thanks to my family who knew more about **nutrition**. That is how I started looking very carefully at what I ate or consumed altogether. 

Of course, later, this stemmed into a whole overall pattern of **discipline**. I had noticed, before too long, that consumption is no longer what it used to be and that I had to control not only what went through my mouth but also **what I watched**. **Dopamine detox** and struggle had started to look very exciting in contrast to the life I had led up to this point, full of comfort. I started to, therefore, chase struggle and discomfort as a means to become my own main character.

My martial arts as well as fitness practice is far from over. Recently I have taken multiple classes of Karate Goju-Ryu. These were lot more short-lived as this coincided with my work for my major in Applied Computer Science. In addition I have now embraced discipline as well as physical fitness as a lifestyle.

# Who am I?

I have a strong passion for IT in general. I was born and raised around computers and spent most of my life interacting with them.

This, combined with my keen interest to learn more about how everything works behind the scenes, has provided me with a hunger to learn more about the world of IT. This led me to not only pursue a major in IT, but also to pursue my own studies.

During my time in Thomas More, I have acquired multiple IT-related as well as soft skills. I technically tackled embedded solutions with micro-devices such as the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi, learned operational skills from version control in Git to system administration in both Linux and Windows, learned object-oriented programming in C# and Java which stemmed into web development (ASP.NET, Springboot etc.), data engineering, data science, AI and more.

My journey into coding started with the most basic technologies in web development, which I further studied in Thomas More. Afterwards, I started delving into more complex solutions, such as the aforementioned C# and Java based examples but also in PHP with Laravel as the framework, and later on in React and Next.js.

I also picked up lots of soft skills, having to work with people in certain projects that were assigned to us by Thomas More. I learned that teamwork is very important based on the size of the project and, within such an environment, communication is key.

My interest for coding has only become stronger as I also discovered what it's like to work in a real company on such a job. Needless to say, my journey is far from over.
